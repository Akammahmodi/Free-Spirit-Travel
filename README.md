# Free-Spirit-Travel

https://akammahmodi.github.io/Free-Spirit-Travel/

 
 

created by Akam, Antonio, Ilias and Lisa

We created a travel agency that organises immersive travel experiences in nature depending on what you like. Since a lot of people these days feel the need to re-connect with nature but not everyone knows where to start.

We created this project for our first group assignment in the web development course at BeCode.
You can find our project on Github since this is the code hosting platform that is being used in our course. 
This platform enables us to work together on this project from anywhere. Very usefull in times of lockdown.
